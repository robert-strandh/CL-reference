This project is an attempt at writing a reference manual for the
Common Lisp programming language. 

It differs from the Common Lisp HyperSpec in the following ways:

  * It describes the language features in a more elaborate way,
    including more examples and more explicit information about
    exceptional, undefined, and unspecified behavior. 

  * The contents is in the public domain (in places where such a
    status is possible), which means that it uses a different
    structure and different phrases compared to the HyperSpec. 

  * It has more cross references, annotations, and remarks. 

  * It has a better index. 

We are using LaTeX in order for the printed result to be as nice as
possible.  At the same time, we attempt to use a limited number of
semantic macros so that the source can be parsed and turned into a
variety of formats, e.g., HTML.

The only way this reference manual is ever going to be finished is if
many different people help out.  In that respect, it can be viewed as
an experiment to see whether such collaboration is possible.
