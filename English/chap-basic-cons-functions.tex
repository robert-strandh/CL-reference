\chapter{Basic functions for \texttt{cons} cells}
\label{chap-basic-cons-functions}

\Defun {cons} {car cdr}

This function takes two arbitrary \lisp{} objects and returns a
\texttt{cons} cell with those objects in the \texttt{car} field and
the \texttt{cdr} field respectively.

\Defun {car} {cons}

This function takes either the symbol \texttt{nil} \emph{or} a
\texttt{cons} cell as an argument.  If the symbol \texttt{nil} is
given, then this function returns the symbol \texttt{nil}.  If a
\texttt{cons} cell is given, then this function returns the contents
of the \texttt{car} field of the \texttt{cons} cell.

If an argument other than the symbol \texttt{nil} or a \texttt{cons}
cell is given and the code is \emph{safe}, then an error of type
\texttt{type-error} is signaled.  If the code is not safe, an error
may or may not be signaled. 

\Defun {cdr} {cons}

This function takes either the symbol \texttt{nil} \emph{or} a
\texttt{cons} cell as an argument.  If the symbol \texttt{nil} is
given, then this function returns the symbol \texttt{nil}.  If a
\texttt{cons} cell is given, then this function returns the contents
of the \texttt{cdr} field of the \texttt{cons} cell.

If an argument other than the symbol \texttt{nil} or a \texttt{cons}
cell is given and the code is \emph{safe}, then an error of type
\texttt{type-error} is signaled.  If the code is not safe, an error
may or may not be signaled.

\Defun {first} {cons}

This function is entirely equivalent to the function \texttt{car}.

\Defun {rest} {cons}

This function is entirely equivalent to the function \texttt{cdr}.
